Final Year Project for my Computer Science Degree at the University of Reading

- [Production site](https://selenium-web-tester-prd.herokuapp.com/)
- [Development site](https://selenium-web-tester-dev.herokuapp.com/)

This server is intended to be used with the [Selenium Web Tester](https://github.com/Flujible/FYP-Selenium-Web-Tester) to execute the selenium scripts defined by users of the websites. The website aims to make testing using selenium much easier. The site allows users to create selenium scripts declaratively and have them executed by this server, and have the results returned to them.

Base code taken from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nightwatch) and heavily modified.
